# Sentiment-Analysis-of-movie-reviews-in-IMDB

Movie reviews are an important way to assess the performance of a movie. The ratings provided to a movie by the viewers tells us about the success or failure of a movie quantitatively. However, a collection of movie reviews provides us a deeper qualitative insight on different aspects of the movie. A textual movie review tells us about the strong and weak points of the movie and can tell us if the movie in general meets the expectations of the reviewer.

Sentiment Analysis is a powerful technique which can be used to extract information from the textual reviews. The interpretation and categorization of emotions within text data using text analysis techniques is known as sentiment analysis.

End Goal: Our end goal is to use sentiment analysis on a dataset of 50k movie reviews and analyze the sentiment reviews that each use gave to the movie (negative or positive) and evaluate its performance.
